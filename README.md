# ohms-law-calculator

An Ohm's Law calculator app for electricians and other technicians in the field.

## Bug Found! ##

When seeking Ohms with 2 vals 110 Volts & 100 Watts, produces correct answer of 121 Ohms 
when entering Volts 1st and Watts 2nd. When entering Watts 1st and Volts 2nd, produces
wrong answer of 90.9090

Similar results with any other calculation--must fix!

## MVP

- Fixed size w/mobile 1st in mind
- Technician can, using any two values, can determine quantity of any of four values:
  - Watts (P)
  - Amps (I)
  - Volts (E)
  - Resistance (OHMS) (R)
- UI Should be simple and self-explanatory
  - perhaps a bit of text to help user


### Next step styling ###


#### Later refactoring. ####
